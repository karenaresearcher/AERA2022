# AERA2022
Missing Data and Penalized Regression

The code to run the models is labeled: aeracode_forgit
Users will need to make the following changes to the code:
1) Set your own working directory
2) Establish your file paths for different models.
3) Run the code for each dataset - be sure to change the datafile name to the correct datafile. There are a total of seven datasets. The datasets are named according to the following: missingness type (mar, mcar, or mnar), type of missing data (qual or quan), and percent of missing data (15 or 30).
